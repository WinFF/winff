Description: graphical video and audio batch converter using ffmpeg
 WinFF is a graphical user interface for FFmpeg. It will convert
 almost any video file that FFmpeg will convert. WinFF does multiple
 files in multiple formats at one time. You can, for example, convert
 mpeg's, flv's, and mov's into avi's (or DVD/VCD format or MPEG or 3gp
 etc.) all at once.
 .
 This package provides a variety of preset conversion settings for
 common formats and devices. These presets are intended to hit the
 "sweet spot" for each individual codec. They have been written with a
 tip of the balance to quality.
 .
 For most presets to work, it is necessary to have the unstripped version
 of the libavcodec in the multiverse repository, which can be obtained by
 installing ubuntu-restricted-extras or kubuntu-restricted-extras or
 xubuntu-restricted-extras as suggested by this package.

Not all the original presets that come with WinFF work with the Debian
version of ffmpeg. Therefore, a filtered version is provided as a
standard. The original presets are still provided in 
/usr/share/winff/presets-orig.xml and can be loaded into the program.

If you use an unofficial version of ffmpeg you might want the extended
set of presets. For you convenience other versions of the presets are
provided in /usr/share/winff/ and should replace or be merged with your
~/.winff/presets.xml (and /usr/share/winff/presets.xml for system wide
update). Unfortunately the API of ffmpeg changes once in a while, so
you will have to check which version of libavcodec you have. The other
presets files are named after the supported libavcodec.

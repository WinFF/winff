=== Compiling ===

In order to build winff you need the Free Pascal IDE called lazarus [1]. Actually,
you only need lazbuild (which is part of lazarus) and fpc [2], which is needed by
lazbuild. We don't know how new you need these programs, but with fpc older than
2.4.4 we have had issues. Maybe also some code needs lazarus to be not too old.

Currently we have compiled winff with the following versions:
fpc 2.4.4
lazarus 0.9.30

winff is compiled with "lazbuild -B winff.lpr" or manually in the Lazarus IDE.

=== ffmpeg/libav ===

In order to USE winff, you need a working ffmpeg [3] or avconv [4]. But because
the interface to these programs change a lot, you need to check which version
of the presets.xml file you need. The presets files are updated per libavcodec
library. Currently we ship the presets file for ffmpeg/avconv that use libavcodec
version 53, but we already have higher versions available on the winff website.

How to check which version you have?
Run ffmpeg or avconv in a command prompt with the -version option. An example is
given below. Identify the line that says libavcodec and look for the first number.
This is the version that you need to get your presets for.

Example:
paul@wollumbin ~ $ avconv -version
avconv version 9_beta1-6:9~beta1-1, Copyright (c) 2000-2012 the Libav developers
